# Retro Adventure
A text engine for games of high adventure inside your terminal!

## What is it?
Retro Adventure is a Node app that allows you to select and play a text-adventure game file using a simulated REPL. It is meant to be played inside a terminal, and is an homage to the wonderful legacy of text-based adventure games like Zork.

## Install
-  Clone repository
- `npm install`
- `node app.js`

This will bring you to a prompt asking you to select a game file to play. Using the up/down arrows, select the game file to load. Once inside, the REPL will attempt to parse your commands in the game world. Start with `help`.

## Why?
This is mostly just a fun exercise. I had previously worked on a similar browser-based version, and decided to improve on it and make it playable in the terminal instead. I recommend [Cool Retro Term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) for the full retro experience!
